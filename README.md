octets
======

Alpha version on Sourceforge - http://sourceforge.net/projects/octets/

An IP Address Management (IPAM) Application that covers the process of allocating and assigning IP/Network Addresses. Inspired by IPPlan for IP Address Management - good intentions but not good enough for Network Engineers and Architects. 

I initially wrote this in Ruby on Rails 2 (backend) and Adobe Flex 3 (front end). I am graudally going to move the entire application to Rails 4 and rely on HTML 5 + JQuery to deliver the much expected clean UI.
